# Software Testing Notes

## What is Testing in Software Engineering

Testing in Software Engineering is the process of evaluating a software product to determine whether it meets the specified requirements and to identify defects, gaps, or missing requirements.

Software testing can broadly be classified into:
- White Box Testing
- Black Box Testing

---

## Why Software Testing is Important?

Software Testing is important because:
- Bugs or errors can be identified early.
- Issues can be resolved before software delivery.
- It ensures reliability, security, and high performance.
- It helps save time and cost.
- It improves customer satisfaction.

## Software Failures That Made Global Headlines

1. **China Airlines Airbus A300 Crash** (April 26, 1994)  
   **Impact:** 264 lives lost

2. **Military Satellite Launch Failure** (April 1999)  
   **Impact:** $1.2 billion loss – the costliest software-related accident in history

3. **Bloomberg Terminal Crash** (April 2015)  
   **Impact:** 300,000+ traders affected, £3 billion government debt sale postponed

### 1. Functional Testing

Functional testing verifies that each function of the software application operates according to the requirement specification.

**Types of Functional Testing:**
- **Unit Testing** – Tests individual components in isolation
- **Integration Testing** – Tests interaction between integrated modules
- **System Testing** – Tests the complete integrated system end-to-end
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** – Final validation by end users
- **Smoke Testing** – Basic functionality check after deployment
- **Sanity Testing** – Narrow regression testing focused on specific functionality
- **API Testing** – Tests application programming interfaces
- **Database Testing** – Validates data operations and integrity

---

### 2. Non-Functional Testing (Performance Testing)

Non-functional testing evaluates the non-functional aspects of a software application such as performance, usability, reliability, and scalability.

**Types of Non-Functional Testing:**
- **Performance Testing** – Evaluates speed and responsiveness
- **Load Testing** – Tests normal expected load conditions
- **Stress Testing** – Tests beyond normal capacity limits
- **Volume Testing** – Tests with large amounts of data
- **Security Testing** – Checks for vulnerabilities and data protection
- **Usability Testing** – Assesses user experience and ease of use
- **Compatibility Testing** – Tests across different environments
- **Scalability Testing** – Tests system’s ability to scale up or down

---

### 3. Maintenance Testing

Maintenance testing is performed on an existing operational system to ensure that modifications, updates, or migrations do not introduce new defects or negatively impact existing functionality.

**Types of Maintenance Testing:**
- **Regression Testing** – Ensures existing features work after code changes
- **Maintenance Testing** – Tests after system modifications or updates
- **Impact Analysis Testing** – Identifies areas affected by changes
- **Configuration Testing** – Tests different hardware and software configurations
